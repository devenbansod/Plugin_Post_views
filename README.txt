Post_views is a simple Wordpress plugin to track (and display) the views of all the posts and the pages of a blog.

== Description ==

* Wordpress plugin for viewing number of views for the Posts and Pages of a website.
* This simple plugin helps the Admins to get the information about the 'views till date' of various posts on the blog in a form of a stats table.
* This may help them to judge the performance of their authors and may also get the idea of the tastes of their readers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= 1. Can the views be tracked but not output the views on the front-end ? =

Yes. Go to the file, 'post_views.php' and update the defined value of constant named 'DISPLAY_FRONT' to 0.

= 2. Does this show stats for both posts and pages ? =

Yes.

= 3. Can the stats be reset ? =

Yes. Administrators can reset the views of any page/post back to zero. Once reset, the previous view counts can not be recovered.
